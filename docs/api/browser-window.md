# BrowserWindow

> Create and control browser windows.

```javascript
// In the main process.
const {BrowserWindow} = require('electron')

// Or in the renderer process.
const {BrowserWindow} = require('electron').remote

let win = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600})
win.on('closed', () => {
  win = null
})

win.loadURL('https://github.com')
```

## Frameless window

To create a window without chrome, or a transparent window in arbitrary shape,
you can use the [Frameless Window](frameless-window.md) API.

## Showing window gracefully

When loading a page in window directly, users will see the progress of loading
page, which is not good experience for native app. To make the window display
without visual flash, there are two solutions for different situations.

### Using `ready-to-show` event

While loading the page, the `ready-to-show` event will be emitted when renderer
process has done drawing for the first time, showing window after this event
will have no visual flash:

```javascript
let win = new BrowserWindow({show: false})
win.once('ready-to-show', () => {
  win.show()
})
```

This is event is usually emitted after the `did-finish-load` event, but for
pages with many remote resources, it may be emitted before the `did-finish-load`
event.

### Setting `backgroundColor`

For a complex app, the `ready-to-show` event could be emitted too late, making
the app feel slow. In this case, it is recommended to show the window
immediately, and use a `backgroundColor` close to your app's background:

```javascript
let win = new BrowserWindow({backgroundColor: '#2e2c29'})
win.loadURL('https://github.com')
```

Note that even for apps that use `ready-to-show` event, it is still recommended
to set `backgroundColor` to make app feel more native.

## Parent and child windows

By using `parent` option, you can create child windows:

```javascript
let top = new BrowserWindow()
let child = new BrowserWindow({parent: top})
```

The `child` window will always show on top of the `top` window.

### Modal windows

A modal window is a child window that disables parent window, to create a modal
window, you have to set both `parent` and `modal` options:

```javascript
let child = new BrowserWindow({parent: top, modal: true, show: false})
child.loadURL('https://github.com')
child.once('ready-to-show', () => {
  child.show()
})
```

### Platform notices

* On macOS the child windows will keep the relative position to parent window
  when parent window moves, while on Windows and Linux child windows will not
  move.
* On Windows it is not supported to change parent window dynamically.
* On Linux the type of modal windows will be changed to `dialog`.
* On Linux many desktop environments do not support hiding a modal window.

## Class: BrowserWindow

`BrowserWindow` is an
[EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter).

It creates a new `BrowserWindow` with native properties as set by the `options`.

### `new BrowserWindow([options])`

* `options` Object
  * `width` Integer - Window's width in pixels. Default is `800`.
  * `height` Integer - Window's height in pixels. Default is `600`.
  * `x` Integer (**required** if y is used) - Window's left offset from screen.
    Default is to center the window.
  * `y` Integer (**required** if x is used) - Window's top offset from screen.
    Default is to center the window.
  * `useContentSize` Boolean - The `width` and `height` would be used as web
    page's size, which means the actual window's size will include window
    frame's size and be slightly larger. Default is `false`.
  * `center` Boolean - Show window in the center of the screen.
  * `minWidth` Integer - Window's minimum width. Default is `0`.
  * `minHeight` Integer - Window's minimum height. Default is `0`.
  * `maxWidth` Integer - Window's maximum width. Default is no limit.
  * `maxHeight` Integer - Window's maximum height. Default is no limit.
  * `resizable` Boolean - Whether window is resizable. Default is `true`.
  * `movable` Boolean - Whether window is movable. This is not implemented
    on Linux. Default is `true`.
  * `minimizable` Boolean - Whether window is minimizable. This is not
    implemented on Linux. Default is `true`.
  * `maximizable` Boolean - Whether window is maximizable. This is not
    implemented on Linux. Default is `true`.
  * `closable` Boolean - Whether window is closable. This is not implemented
    on Linux. Default is `true`.
  * `focusable` Boolean - Whether the window can be focused. Default is
    `true`. On Windows setting `focusable: false` also implies setting
    `skipTaskbar: true`. On Linux setting `focusable: false` makes the window
    stop interacting with wm, so the window will always stay on top in all
    workspaces.
  * `alwaysOnTop` Boolean - Whether the window should always stay on top of
    other windows. Default is `false`.
  * `fullscreen` Boolean - Whether the window should show in fullscreen. When
    explicitly set to `false` the fullscreen button will be hidden or disabled
    on macOS. Default is `false`.
  * `fullscreenable` Boolean - Whether the window can be put into fullscreen
    mode. On macOS, also whether the maximize/zoom button should toggle full
    screen mode or maximize window. Default is `true`.
  * `skipTaskbar` Boolean - Whether to show the window in taskbar. Default is
    `false`.
  * `kiosk` Boolean - The kiosk mode. Default is `false`.
  * `title` String - Default window title. Default is `"Electron"`.
  * `icon` [NativeImage](native-image.md) - The window icon. On Windows it is
    recommended to use `ICO` icons to get best visual effects, you can also
    leave it undefined so the executable's icon will be used.
  * `show` Boolean - Whether window should be shown when created. Default is
    `true`.
  * `frame` Boolean - Specify `false` to create a
    [Frameless Window](frameless-window.md). Default is `true`.
  * `parent` BrowserWindow - Specify parent window. Default is `null`.
  * `modal` Boolean - Whether this is a modal window. This only works when the
    window is a child window. Default is `false`.
  * `acceptFirstMouse` Boolean - Whether the web view accepts a single
    mouse-down event that simultaneously activates the window. Default is
    `false`.
  * `disableAutoHideCursor` Boolean - Whether to hide cursor when typing.
    Default is `false`.
  * `autoHideMenuBar` Boolean - Auto hide the menu bar unless the `Alt`
    key is pressed. Default is `false`.
  * `enableLargerThanScreen` Boolean - Enable the window to be resized larger
    than screen. Default is `false`.
  * `backgroundColor` String - Window's background color as Hexadecimal value,
    like `#66CD00` or `#FFF` or `#80FFFFFF` (alpha is supported). Default is
    `#FFF` (white).
  * `hasShadow` Boolean - Whether window should have a shadow. This is only
    implemented on macOS. Default is `true`.
  * `darkTheme` Boolean - Forces using dark theme for the window, only works on
    some GTK+3 desktop environments. Default is `false`.
  * `transparent` Boolean - Makes the window [transparent](frameless-window.md).
    Default is `false`.
  * `type` String - The type of window, default is normal window. See more about
    this below.
  * `titleBarStyle` String - The style of window title bar. See more about this
    below.
  * `thickFrame` Boolean - Use `WS_THICKFRAME` style for frameless windows on
    Windows, which adds standard window frame. Setting it to `false` will remove
    window shadow and window animations. Default is `true`.
  * `webPreferences` Object - Settings of web page's features. See more about
    this below.

When setting minimum or maximum window size with `minWidth`/`maxWidth`/
`minHeight`/`maxHeight`, it only constrains the users. It won't prevent you from
passing a size that does not follow size constraints to `setBounds`/`setSize` or
to the constructor of `BrowserWindow`.

The possible values and behaviors of the `type` option are platform dependent.
Possible values are:

* On Linux, possible types are `desktop`, `dock`, `toolbar`, `splash`,
  `notification`.
* On macOS, possible types are `desktop`, `textured`.
  * The `textured` type adds metal gradient appearance
    (`NSTexturedBackgroundWindowMask`).
  * The `desktop` type places the window at the desktop background window level
    (`kCGDesktopWindowLevel - 1`). Note that desktop window will not receive
    focus, keyboard or mouse events, but you can use `globalShortcut` to receive
    input sparingly.
* On Windows, possible type is `toolbar`.

The `titleBarStyle` option is only supported on macOS 10.10 Yosemite and newer.
Possible values are:

* `default` or not specified, results in the standard gray opaque Mac title
  bar.
* `hidden` results in a hidden title bar and a full size content window, yet
  the title bar still has the standard window controls ("traffic lights") in
  the top left.
* `hidden-inset` results in a hidden title bar with an alternative look
  where the traffic light buttons are slightly more inset from the window edge.

The `webPreferences` option is an object that can have the following properties:

* `nodeIntegration` Boolean - Whether node integration is enabled. Default
  is `true`.
* `preload` String - Specifies a script that will be loaded before other
  scripts run in the page. This script will always have access to node APIs
  no matter whether node integration is turned on or off. The value should
  be the absolute file path to the script.
  When node integration is turned off, the preload script can reintroduce
  Node global symbols back to the global scope. See example
  [here](process.md#event-loaded).
* `session` [Session](session.md#class-session) - Sets the session used by the
  page. Instead of passing the Session object directly, you can also choose to
  use the `partition` option instead, which accepts a partition string. When
  both `session` and `partition` are provided, `session` will be preferred.
  Default is the default session.
* `partition` String - Sets the session used by the page according to the
  session's partition string. If `partition` starts with `persist:`, the page
  will use a persistent session available to all pages in the app with the
  same `partition`. If there is no `persist:` prefix, the page will use an
  in-memory session. By assigning the same `partition`, multiple pages can share
  the same session. Default is the default session.
* `zoomFactor` Number - The default zoom factor of the page, `3.0` represents
  `300%`. Default is `1.0`.
* `javascript` Boolean - Enables JavaScript support. Default is `true`.
* `webSecurity` Boolean - When `false`, it will disable the
  same-origin policy (usually using testing websites by people), and set
  `allowDisplayingInsecureContent` and `allowRunningInsecureContent` to
  `true` if these two options are not set by user. Default is `true`.
* `allowDisplayingInsecureContent` Boolean - Allow an https page to display
  content like images from http URLs. Default is `false`.
* `allowRunningInsecureContent` Boolean - Allow an https page to run
  JavaScript, CSS or plugins from http URLs. Default is `false`.
* `images` Boolean - Enables image support. Default is `true`.
* `textAreasAreResizable` Boolean - Make TextArea elements resizable. Default
  is `true`.
* `webgl` Boolean - Enables WebGL support. Default is `true`.
* `webaudio` Boolean - Enables WebAudio support. Default is `true`.
* `plugins` Boolean - Whether plugins should be enabled. Default is `false`.
* `experimentalFeatures` Boolean - Enables Chromium's experimental features.
  Default is `false`.
* `experimentalCanvasFeatures` Boolean - Enables Chromium's experimental
  canvas features. Default is `false`.
* `directWrite` Boolean - Enables DirectWrite font rendering system on
  Windows. Default is `true`.
* `scrollBounce` Boolean - Enables scroll bounce (rubber banding) effect on
  macOS. Default is `false`.
* `blinkFeatures` String - A list of feature strings separated by `,`, like
  `CSSVariables,KeyboardEventKey` to enable. The full list of supported feature
  strings can be found in the [RuntimeEnabledFeatures.in][blink-feature-string]
  file.
* `disableBlinkFeatures` String - A list of feature strings separated by `,`,
  like `CSSVariables,KeyboardEventKey` to disable. The full list of supported
  feature strings can be found in the
  [RuntimeEnabledFeatures.in][blink-feature-string] file.
* `defaultFontFamily` Object - Sets the default font for the font-family.
  * `standard` String - Defaults to `Times New Roman`.
  * `serif` String - Defaults to `Times New Roman`.
  * `sansSerif` String - Defaults to `Arial`.

* `backgroundThrottling` Boolean - Whether to throttle animations and timers
  when the page becomes background. Defaults to `true`.

### Instance Events

Objects created with `new BrowserWindow` emit the following events:

**Note:** Some events are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

#### Event: 'page-title-updated'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the document changed its title, calling `event.preventDefault()`
will prevent the native window's title from changing.

#### Event: 'close'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window is going to be closed. It's emitted before the
`beforeunload` and `unload` event of the DOM. Calling `event.preventDefault()`
will cancel the close.

Usually you would want to use the `beforeunload` handler to decide whether the
window should be closed, which will also be called when the window is
reloaded. In Electron, returning any value other than `undefined` would cancel the
close. For example:

```javascript
window.onbeforeunload = (e) => {
  console.log('I do not want to be closed');

  // Unlike usual browsers that a message box will be prompted to users, returning
  // a non-void value will silently cancel the close.
  // It is recommended to use the dialog API to let the user confirm closing the
  // application.
  e.returnValue = false;
};
```

#### Event: 'closed'

Emitted when the window is closed. After you have received this event you should
remove the reference to the window and avoid using it any more.

#### Event: 'unresponsive'

Emitted when the web page becomes unresponsive.

#### Event: 'responsive'

Emitted when the unresponsive web page becomes responsive again.

#### Event: 'blur'

Emitted when the window loses focus.

#### Event: 'focus'

Emitted when the window gains focus.

#### Event: 'show'

Emitted when the window is shown.

#### Event: 'hide'

Emitted when the window is hidden.

#### Event: 'ready-to-show'

Emitted when the web page has been rendered and window can be displayed without
a visual flash.

#### Event: 'maximize'

Emitted when window is maximized.

#### Event: 'unmaximize'

Emitted when the window exits from a maximized state.

#### Event: 'minimize'

Emitted when the window is minimized.

#### Event: 'restore'

Emitted when the window is restored from a minimized state.

#### Event: 'resize'

Emitted when the window is being resized.

#### Event: 'move'

Emitted when the window is being moved to a new position.

__Note__: On macOS this event is just an alias of `moved`.

#### Event: 'moved' _macOS_

Emitted once when the window is moved to a new position.

#### Event: 'enter-full-screen'

Emitted when the window enters a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'leave-full-screen'

Emitted when the window leaves a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'enter-html-full-screen'

Emitted when the window enters a full-screen state triggered by HTML API.

#### Event: 'leave-html-full-screen'

Emitted when the window leaves a full-screen state triggered by HTML API.

#### Event: 'app-command' _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `command` String

Emitted when an [App Command](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646275(v=vs.85).aspx)
is invoked. These are typically related to keyboard media keys or browser
commands, as well as the "Back" button built into some mice on Windows.

Commands are lowercased, underscores are replaced with hyphens, and the
`APPCOMMAND_` prefix is stripped off.
e.g. `APPCOMMAND_BROWSER_BACKWARD` is emitted as `browser-backward`.

```javascript
someWindow.on('app-command', (e, cmd) => {
  // Navigate the window back when the user hits their mouse back button
  if (cmd === 'browser-backward' && someWindow.webContents.canGoBack()) {
    someWindow.webContents.goBack();
  }
});
```

#### Event: 'scroll-touch-begin' _macOS_

Emitted when scroll wheel event phase has begun.

#### Event: 'scroll-touch-end' _macOS_

Emitted when scroll wheel event phase has ended.

#### Event: 'swipe' _macOS_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `direction` String

Emitted on 3-finger swipe. Possible directions are `up`, `right`, `down`, `left`.

### Static Methods

The `BrowserWindow` class has the following static methods:

#### `BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()`

Returns an array of all opened browser windows.

#### `BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()`

Returns the window that is focused in this application, otherwise returns `null`.

#### `BrowserWindow.fromWebContents(webContents)`

* `webContents` [WebContents](web-contents.md)

Find a window according to the `webContents` it owns.

#### `BrowserWindow.fromId(id)`

* `id` Integer

Find a window according to its ID.

#### `BrowserWindow.addDevToolsExtension(path)`

* `path` String

Adds DevTools extension located at `path`, and returns extension's name.

The extension will be remembered so you only need to call this API once, this
API is not for programming use. If you try to add an extension that has already
been loaded, this method will not return and instead log a warning to the
console.

The method will also not return if the extension's manifest is missing or incomplete.

**Note:** This API cannot be called before the `ready` event of the `app` module
is emitted.

#### `BrowserWindow.removeDevToolsExtension(name)`

* `name` String

Remove a DevTools extension by name.

**Note:** This API cannot be called before the `ready` event of the `app` module
is emitted.

#### `BrowserWindow.getDevToolsExtensions()`

Returns an Object where the keys are the extension names and each value is
an Object containing `name` and `version` properties.

To check if a DevTools extension is installed you can run the following:

```javascript
let installed = BrowserWindow.getDevToolsExtensions().hasOwnProperty('devtron')
```

**Note:** This API cannot be called before the `ready` event of the `app` module
is emitted.

### Instance Properties

Objects created with `new BrowserWindow` have the following properties:

```javascript
// In this example `win` is our instance
let win = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600});
```

#### `win.webContents`

The `WebContents` object this window owns. All web page related events and
operations will be done via it.

See the [`webContents` documentation](web-contents.md) for its methods and
events.

#### `win.id`

The unique ID of the window.

### Instance Methods

Objects created with `new BrowserWindow` have the following instance methods:

**Note:** Some methods are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

#### `win.destroy()`

Force closing the window, the `unload` and `beforeunload` event won't be emitted
for the web page, and `close` event will also not be emitted
for this window, but it guarantees the `closed` event will be emitted.

#### `win.close()`

Try to close the window. This has the same effect as a user manually clicking
the close button of the window. The web page may cancel the close though. See
the [close event](#event-close).

#### `win.focus()`

Focuses on the window.

#### `win.blur()`

Removes focus from the window.

#### `win.isFocused()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is focused.

#### `win.show()`

Shows and gives focus to the window.

#### `win.showInactive()`

Shows the window but doesn't focus on it.

#### `win.hide()`

Hides the window.

#### `win.isVisible()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is visible to the user.

#### `win.isModal()`

Returns a boolean, whether current window is a modal window.

#### `win.maximize()`

Maximizes the window.

#### `win.unmaximize()`

Unmaximizes the window.

#### `win.isMaximized()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is maximized.

#### `win.minimize()`

Minimizes the window. On some platforms the minimized window will be shown in
the Dock.

#### `win.restore()`

Restores the window from minimized state to its previous state.

Sets whether the window should be in fullscreen mode.

#### `win.isFullScreen()`

Returns a boolean, whether the window is in fullscreen mode.

#### `win.setAspectRatio(aspectRatio[, extraSize])` _macOS_

* `aspectRatio` The aspect ratio to maintain for some portion of the
content view.
* `extraSize` Object (optional) - The extra size not to be included while
maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * `width` Integer
  * `height` Integer

This will make a window maintain an aspect ratio. The extra size allows a
developer to have space, specified in pixels, not included within the aspect
ratio calculations. This API already takes into account the difference between a
window's size and its content size.

Consider a normal window with an HD video player and associated controls.
Perhaps there are 15 pixels of controls on the left edge, 25 pixels of controls
on the right edge and 50 pixels of controls below the player. In order to
maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio (standard aspect ratio for HD @1920x1080) within
the player itself we would call this function with arguments of 16/9 and
[ 40, 50 ]. The second argument doesn't care where the extra width and height
are within the content view--only that they exist. Just sum any extra width and
height areas you have within the overall content view.

#### `win.setThumbarButtons(buttons)` _Windows_

* `buttons` Array

Add a thumbnail toolbar with a specified set of buttons to the thumbnail image
of a window in a taskbar button layout. Returns a `Boolean` object indicates
whether the thumbnail has been added successfully.

The number of buttons in thumbnail toolbar should be no greater than 7 due to
the limited room. Once you setup the thumbnail toolbar, the toolbar cannot be
removed due to the platform's limitation. But you can call the API with an empty
array to clean the buttons.

The `buttons` is an array of `Button` objects:

* `Button` Object
  * `icon` [NativeImage](native-image.md) - The icon showing in thumbnail
    toolbar.
  * `click` Function
  * `tooltip` String (optional) - The text of the button's tooltip.
  * `flags` Array (optional) - Control specific states and behaviors of the
    button. By default, it is `['enabled']`.

The `flags` is an array that can include following `String`s:

* `enabled` - The button is active and available to the user.
* `disabled` - The button is disabled. It is present, but has a visual state
  indicating it will not respond to user action.
* `dismissonclick` - When the button is clicked, the thumbnail window closes
  immediately.
* `nobackground` - Do not draw a button border, use only the image.
* `hidden` - The button is not shown to the user.
* `noninteractive` - The button is enabled but not interactive; no pressed
  button state is drawn. This value is intended for instances where the button
  is used in a notification.

hovering over the window in the taskbar. You can reset the thumbnail to be
the entire window by specifying an empty region:
`{x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 0}`.
